# Divided into portions:

1. create a git hub repo for the project
2. find a way to map the mrt map in code
- enum (diff py file), linked list, graph

a) For Enum method, you can initalise a enum by using:

import Enum
class Season(Enum):
    Pasir_ris = EW1 
    Tampines = EW2
    .....
! define in caps

! for enums, useful functions include:

Use enums if theres a fixed set of options (eg: on/off)



eg:

class Color(Enum): # init your enums

 	red: str = 'R'

​	green: str = 'G'



! To obtain R/G, print(Color.red.value)

def create_car(color: Color) -> None: 

​	match color: # does a check

​		case Color.red:

​			print("a red car is created")

​		case Color.green:

​			print("a green car is created")



yellow_and_red: Color = Color.yellow | Color.red # stores both colors

Dakota: Color = Color.yellow



if Dakota in yellow_and_red:

​	print("Dakota is either of CCL or NSL")

else:

​	print("the station is not in both CCL and NSL")



Attempt at using enum to create the library:

​	1. add all stations as enums into the programme

this can be carried out by labelling the stations by its lines and its station number

! come out a better value to give to the stations if possible

eg:

class Station(stations):

​	pasir_ris: str = "station.EW1"

​	tampines: str = "station.EW1" | "station.DT32"

​	paya_lebar: str = "station.EW8" | "station.CC9"

​	


for each station has the following:

Station number/ name
places it can go to
time it takes for each place


3. save the timings between each mrt station
- doable with step 2

4. accept user inputs 

user inputs will be of two stations, first station being the initial location and the second station being the final location

- rest api, postman for testing
5. attempt to find the fastest way from inputted station to said station
- minimum spanning tree
- topological sort, dijkstra algorithm

after the programme, it shd be able to output the following:
1) the shortest amount of time needed
2) the route that the user shd take in order to reach the location
3) interchanges if there is changes of lines

6. if possible make it into a telegram bot
- research online 

7. Extras
- timings to interchange between the lines shd be done once the library is able to store all the travel timings
- output the second fastest timing and route
- include LRT stations (currently no data on lrt travel timings)
