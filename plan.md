# Divided into portions:

1. create a git hub repo for the project
2. find a way to map the mrt map in code
3. save the timings between each mrt station 
4. accept user inputs 

user inputs will be of two stations, first station being the initial location and the second station being the final location

- rest api, postman for testing
5. attempt to find the fastest way from inputted station to said station
- minimum spanning tree
- topological sort, dijkstra algorithm

after the programme, it shd be able to output the following:
1) the shortest amount of time needed
2) the route that the user shd take in order to reach the location
3) interchanges if there is changes of lines

6. if possible make it into a telegram bot
- research online 

7. Extras
- output the second fastest timing and route
- include LRT stations (currently no data on lrt travel timings)
- Output the route more nicely
- Consider using a database (SQL) for further learning
- Output potential train wait timings as they are not factored into the equation
a) Consider peak and non peak timings
- Fix the LRT timings and also add in both LRT stations
